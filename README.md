# DragonMasters
Created by Lucy Arrowsmith

This is a project designed to help the coaches of Victorian Dragon Masterâ€™s team to organise regattas and team member placements.
Stephen Arrowsmith reached out to update the currently used operating system (excel) to a more accessible and efficient practice.
The user group are 60+ year olds with extensive knowledge in Excel but and not easily adaptable to new technology and its uses.
This project is aimed to be simplistic, easily readable and conforms to WCAG for accessible design. 
This will be used on multiple transportable devices (iPads and laptops).

Currently working to integrate API, rather than local storage. This will be done via Vercel.
And to be accessible across multiple users that can edit races simultaneously. 

Am using Bootstrap and CSS to design aspects of the interface for a responsive design.

The main features of this project are:
1) Store multiple races in an event, with participating members added and displayed.
2) Adding and removing events/races.
3) Each boat race has specific requirements that must be met. These include:
     * Weight distribution back-to-front and left-to-right to be within a margin.
     * Age, class and gender based.
     * Evenly distributed races for participating members. 
     * Drag and drop features for user to visually create a boat and it's members.
     * Sort and filter functions when choosing members based off requirements and preferences. 
     * Storing previous races for feedback in the future.
     * Race placements and reviews - including graph analytics. 
4) Storing and protecting member information.
